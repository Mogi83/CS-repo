    "\n",
    "I liked this challenge, but it took me far longer than the intended 30 minutes youd expect of the class, of course I am just one student so it could just be me who took more time. I wanted to give you props for the effort in getting the class involved with some active learning skill the lemur caught me off guard. I am curious to see your approach to those optional chapters we talked about, im still thinking the extra credit should be low (like 1 point for reading the chapter, 1 for the lab of that chapter, and 1 for the optional exam question for that chapter) my Physics class does 3% extra credit overall. However you decide to get (or not get) that extra credit is up to the student but 3% is fair. \n",

    "Feedback for this code:\n",
    "Is this too much commenting? Not enough? Is there a better way to do this?\n",

    "### Some other ideas for you that the class might hate but might be a good learning activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group coding assignment: Similar to the Labs in format but I am thinking more of a take home idea. There should be some consideration as to preventing one person in the group from doing all the work. My remedy would be to require the use of a github repo as I think it would be a practical skill for people to get acustomed to and the barrier to entry is fairly low when using the desktop client (I would not expect anyone to be using git CLI). You could see who pushed commits and who didnt to see if the group work was \"fair\" At the same time this could be opening a can of worms trying to help folks understand github and diagnose merging pull requests this idea could get messy very quickly. This also could be a huge grading pain for you so maybe not the best idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reviews and Unit tests:\n",
    "Personally I would greatly appreciate getting into the habit, being corrected on, and shown what is considered best practices, I recall iloc vs loc or setting your random_state. We mostly already do this but I could see us posting our code somewhere for review and then breaking it apart in class (anonymized) to say what is good or what is bad about said code. Of course this is subjective but you've seen the errors of your 334 class what do you want us to get right before we get to that level? Before we head into 233 (I am hopeful for a fall session that way I could do 133, 233, and 334 back to back to back)\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Projects:\n",
    "Again im pushing for projects but this might be over the course of an entire unit instead of the homeworks which cover a homework portion (or a whole unit like unit 1). It could be valuable for us to do every step of the data science lifecycle we saw in chapter one (minus data collection and likely very simplified) maybe thats saved for 233, either way would be neat.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these suggestions my thought process is that 133 prepares the non CS for practical data science in their fields so that even if they never take another data science course they might still be able to do the core tasks of data science or at the bare minimum collect cleaner data. With that I would think that 233 is more geared towards the CS crowd or the people in this class that say \"you know this is kinda useful in my field\", and 334 is all in for CS folks. My intention for these suggestions isn't to add more work for the sake of adding more work but to be able to walk away from this class thinking that it was worth taking. I am huge proponent of learning by doing through practical experinces/assignments in the classroom that way if a student doesn't go on to 233 they can still take what they learned (even if they forget 90%) into their related science field with the ideas of where their data might go. Additionally I think having a scientest that at least considers where their data goes is far better than a scientest who only knows their area of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just some thoughts I wanted to throw out there! My ADHD brain tends to wander toward questions like 'How do we improve 133?' and 'Why?' in the background. I am curious to hear what you think! Either way, looking forward to class."
